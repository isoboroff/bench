#+title: Notes and issues and plans for the Bench app

* Updates for NeuCLIR

** TODO Change the search layout from an accordion to a blue-link list with snippets, and open documents in a new tab

** DONE Port to run on Patapsco instead of ElasticSearch
CLOSED: [2022-05-17 Tue 17:04]
- backend changes done

** TODO note language of relevant documents labeled

** TODO add an inventory tab that lists all topics with title and count of reldocs by lang

* Updates needed for BETTER IR development

** DONE Arabic search support

*** DONE Figure out Arabic indexing into ElasticSearch

- Determined that there is a built-in Arabic analyzer
- Investigated Farasa and MADAMIRA but integration looks to be quite challenging for both.

*** DONE Can we do Spacy extractions for facets?

- Spacy does not do Arabic.


** TODO Multiple search tabs (one for English, one for Arabic)

*** DONE make the search index a parameter setting
*** TODO make the facets specified at the search tab
    - Almost there, entity rendering in the card is the last thing.

** DONE Topic development template
CLOSED: [2021-11-23 Tue 12:56]

   - The application should specify the template as a JS object and
     give it to the Topic editor's props.

** DONE Highlights for relevance, rather than checkboxes

* Improvements to the system

  ** Make the different app components (like a search tab on a collection, a topic writeup, a review pane) composable in a top-level App, easily.

  ** Retargetable search tab: just specify endpoint and collection, with optional facet fields

  ** Specify the writeup tab setup with a JSON template

  ** Each tab component should manage its own state and save/restore functionality
  
  
  ** Support complex Lucene queries.  Have a popup with query syntax, and report erroneous queries.

  ** Spin a wheel while waiting for the query to come back

  ** Allow clicking on documents in the topic editor.  This should bring up a tab in the context for that document, that is, for its topic and request.  This document view should be the same as the ones that come off the search results list.
