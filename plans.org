#+title: Notes and issues and plans for the Bench app

* Needed for News Track 2021:

** TODO Two tabs: search and topic dev
** TODO Topic dev template modifications for task
** TODO Check WaPo document rendering

* Improvements to the system

  ** Make the different app components (like a search tab on a collection, a topic writeup, a review pane) composable in a top-level App, easily.

  ** Retargetable search tab: just specify endpoint and collection, with optional facet fields

  ** Specify the writeup tab setup with a JSON template

  ** Each tab component should manage its own state and save/restore functionality
